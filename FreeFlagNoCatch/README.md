# Free Flag No Catch

By David Nguyen, UCLA.

Wow this one will just give you the flag for refreshing! Guess the organizers
messed up...

## Hint

Cookies are tasty. Can I bake my own?

## Solution 

You should notice that the user name provided by the app has some
significance, and that the app seems to remember the user name across
different pages. So this should remind you to check your cookies. Different
browsers have different developer consoles, and through these, you can usually
change the value of any stored cookie fairly easily. Alternatively you can use
`document.cookie = "user=root";'` to set the cookie.
