<h1>Free Flag, No Catch</h1>
<p>Hello new visitor: <b>{{ user }}</b>.</p>
<p>
So here's the deal, I procrastinated and didn't really have time to write a problem for CTF. I'm sorry so let me do right by you and just give you the flag. Refresh and visit the page again and I'll give it to you.</p>

<input type="button" value="Refresh Page" onClick="history.go(0)">
